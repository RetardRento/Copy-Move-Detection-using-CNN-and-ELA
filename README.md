# Copy-Move-Detection-using-CNN-and-ELA
the ipynb file is very well detailed, going through it will make you understand the process of executing the ELA conversion plus the whole training process on the dataset, we used the CASIA dataset for this with both the authentic and tampered images as training inputs with a good enough accuracy
